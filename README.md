* [Flutter App](https://github.com/VictorRancesCode/Covid19/tree/master/covid19)

The project is about creating an application (Flutter) where people can register, add their geolocation, add their family or friends to see their status, carry out a self-assessment in the event that a suspect comes out, they will notify the nearest hospital registered in the system, see the statistics of your city, country or province (Based on the data entered by the registered hospitals) and if in case one of your relatives is positive for the coronavirus, you will receive a notification to do the self-evaluation, recommendations and see areas where there were infections.
When a new hospital is registered, it will send you to an administration panel, where you will receive the notifications of the people self-evaluation they come out as a suspect , in case of positive, the state can be modified as a positive case. 
will notify to all their relatives (who added it), and the panel will show the (registered) people who live near or with the infected person, so that those from the hospital can go to evaluate.

Project in process!!!.
