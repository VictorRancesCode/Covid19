## Covid-19 Bo - Django + Flutter


![Project](https://github.com/VictorRancesCode/Covid19/raw/master/img/banner.jpg) 


* [Flutter App](https://github.com/VictorRancesCode/Covid19/tree/master/covid19)
* [Web](https://github.com/VictorRancesCode/Covid19/tree/master/covid19.web)

The project is about creating an application (Flutter) where people can register, add their geolocation, add their family or friends to see their status, carry out a self-assessment in the event that a suspect comes out, they will notify the nearest hospital registered in the system, see the statistics of your city, country or province (Based on the data entered by the registered hospitals) and if in case one of your relatives is positive for the coronavirus, you will receive a notification to do the self-evaluation, recommendations and see areas where there were infections.
When a new hospital is registered, it will send you to an administration panel, where you will receive the notifications of the people self-evaluation they come out as a suspect , in case of positive, the state can be modified as a positive case. 
will notify to all their relatives (who added it), and the panel will show the (registered) people who live near or with the infected person, so that those from the hospital can go to evaluate.


## Inspiration

People's need for the information about Covid-19 that their country carries, to see in which areas there were people who became infected and hospitals to know which people are the relatives of the internal who tested positive, to also carry out tests

## What it does

#### Web
* Register Your Country, Departments and Provinces
* Register User
* Register Hospitals
* See country statistics
* See the people and addresses (geolocation) they identified as a suspect in the self-assessment
* See (registered) people who live nearby or who live with the patient who has covid-19.
* Notify family and friends who added the patient who tested positive for covid-19.
* Add places where there were infections and people who tested positive for covid-19
* The administrator will be able to create and edit a questionnaire so that people can carry out a self-evaluation

#### App
* Login User
* Register User
* See country statistics
* View the list of news recommended by system administrators
* Add Family and friends to know their status
* If a family or friend tested positive, a notification arrives
* list of recommendations added by the system administrator
* Carry out a self-assessment and if in the case of a suspect, they will notify the nearest hospital (registered) so that they can go and do the test
* See on the map the areas where there were infections
* See the list of registered hospitals
